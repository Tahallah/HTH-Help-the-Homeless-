# HTH-Help-the-Homeless-
Our topic was to create an application or a website that could help combat homelessness, we created a centralized website that focused on the community aspect of homelessness that provides resources and help for those in need. We included features such as community events and an integrated Google Maps API that contained the location for all physical resources and events we planned for homeless people.
